            <p>Growing up in a country with limited access 
                to technology sparked my curiosity and passion for computers. 
                I became fascinated by technology's capabilities, which led me 
                to pursue a bachelor of science degree in computer science BS. 
                When I took my first programming class in Java it was very challenging 
                but with the help of my teachers, I learned the programming fundamentals 
                and discovered my real passion for tracing an Algorithm and programming it.

                Currently a Computer Science major as well as an intern representative of 
                the Department of Education Technology Support. These help me I have honed many valuable skills.</p>
